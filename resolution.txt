ANNEX
DECLARATION ON PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CONCERNING
FRIENDLY RELATIONS AND CO-OPERATION AMONG STATES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS
PREAMBLE
The General Assembly,
Reaffirming in the terms of the Charter of the United
Nations that the maintenance of international peace and
security and the development of friendly relations and cooperation between nations are among the fundamental purposes
of the United Nations,
Recalling that the peoples of the United Nations are
determined to practise tolerance and live together in peace
with one another as good neighbours,
Bearing in mind the importance of maintaining and
strengthening international peace founded upon freedom,
equality, justice and respect for fundamental human rights
and of developing friendly relations among nations
irrespective of their political, economic and social systems
or the levels of their development,
Bearing in mind also the paramount importance of the Charter
of the United Nations in the promotion of the rule of law
among nations,
Considering that the faithful observance of the principles
of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among States and the fulfillment in good faith of
the obligations assumed by States, in accordance with the
Charter, is of the greatest importance for the maintenance
of international peace and security and for the
implementation of the other purposes of the United Nations,
Noting that the great political, economic and social changes
and scientific progress which have taken place in the world
since the adoption of the Charter give increased importance
to these principles and to the need for their more effective
application in the conduct of States wherever carried on,
Recalling the established principle that outer space,
including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not
subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty,
by means of use or occupation, or by any other means, and
mindful of the fact that consideration is being given in the 
United Nations to the question of establishing other
appropriate provisions similarly inspired,
Convinced that the strict observance by States of the
obligation not to intervene in the affairs of any other
State is an essential condition to ensure that nations live
together in peace with one another, since the practice of
any form of intervention not only violates the spirit and
letter of the Charter, but also leads to the creation of
situations which threaten international peace and security,
Recalling the duty of States to refrain in their
international relations from military, political, economic
or any other form of coercion aimed against the political
independence or territorial integrity of any State,
Considering it essential that all States shall refrain in
their international relations from the threat or use of
force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any State, or in any other manner
inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,
Considering it equally essential that all States shall
settle their international disputes by peaceful means in
accordance with the Charter,
Reaffirming, in accordance with the Charter, the basic
importance of sovereign equality and stressing that the
purposes of the United Nations can be implemented only if
States enjoy sovereign equality and comply fully with the
requirements of this principle in their international
relations,
Convinced that the subjection of peoples to alien
subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a major
obstacle to the promotion of international peace and
security, Convinced that the principle of equal rights and
self-determination of peoples constitutes a significant
contribution to contemporary international law, and that its
effective application is of paramount importance for the
promotion of friendly relations among States, based on
respect for the principle of sovereign equality,
Convinced in consequence that any attempt aimed at the
partial or total disruption of the national unity and
territorial integrity of a State or country or at its
political independence is incompatible with the purposes and
principles of the Charter,
Considering the provisions of the Charter as a whole and
taking into account the role of relevant resolutions adopted 
by the competent organs of the United Nations relating to
the content of the principles,
Considering that the progressive development and
codification of the following principles:
(a) The principle that States shall refrain in their
international relations from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations,
(b) The principle that States shall settle their
international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner
that international peace and security and justice are not
endangered,
(c) The duty not to intervene in matters within the domestic
jurisdiction of any State, in accordance with the Charter,
(d) The duty of States to co-operate with one another in
accordance with the Charter,
(e) The principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples,
(f) The principle of sovereign equality of States,
(g) The principle that States shall fulfil in good faith the
obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter,
so as to secure their more effective application within the
international community, would promote the realization of
the purposes of the United Nations,
Having considered the principles of international law
relating to friendly relations and co-operation among States,
1. Solemnly proclaims the following principles:
The principle that States shall refrain in their
international ~ relations from the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations
Every State has the duty to refrain in its international
relations from the threat or use of force against the
territorial integrity or political independence of any State,
or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the
United Nations. Such a threat or use of force constitutes a 
violation of international law and the Charter of the United
Nations and shall never be employed as a means of settling
international issues.
A war of aggression constitutes a crime against the peace,
for which there is responsibility under international law.
In accordance with the purposes and principles of the United
Nations, States have the duty to refrain from propaganda for
wars of aggression.
Every State has the duty to refrain from the threat or use
of force to violate the existing international boundaries of
another State or as a means of solving international
disputes, including territorial disputes and problems
concerning frontiers of States.
Every State likewise has the duty to refrain from the threat
or use of force to violate international lines of
demarcation, such as armistice lines, established by or
pursuant to an international agreement to which it is a
party or which it is otherwise bound to respect. Nothing in
the foregoing shall be construed as prejudicing the
positions of the parties concerned with regard to the status
and effects of such lines under their special regimes or as
affecting their temporary character.
States have a duty to refrain from acts of reprisal
involving the use of force.
Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action
which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the
principle of equal rights and self-determination of their
right to self-determination and freedom and independence.
Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing or
encouraging the organization of irregular forces or armed
bands including mercenaries, for incursion into the
territory of another State.
Every State has the duty to refrain from organizing,
instigating, assisting or participating in acts of civil
strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiescing in
organized activities within its territory directed towards
the commission of such acts, when the acts referred to in
the present paragraph involve a threat or use of force.
The territory of a State shall not be the object of military
occupation resulting from the use of force in contravention
of the provisions of the Charter. The territory of a State
shall not be the object of acquisition by another State
resulting from the threat or use of force. No territorial 
acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall
be recognized as legal. Nothing in the foregoing shall be
construed as affecting:
(a) Provisions of the Charter or any international agreement
prior to the Charter regime and valid under international
law; or
(b) The powers of the Security Council under the Charter.
All States shall pursue in good faith negotiations for the
early conclusion of a universal treaty on general and
complete disarmament under effective international control
and strive to adopt appropriate measures to reduce
international tensions and strengthen confidence among
States.
All States shall comply in good faith with their obligations
under the generally recognized principles and rules of
international law with respect to the maintenance of
international peace and security, and shall endeavour to
make the United Nations security system based on the Charter
more effective.
Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall be construed as
enlarging or diminishing in any way the scope of the
provisions of the Charter concerning cases in which the use
of force is lawful.
The principle that States shall settle their international
disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that
international peace and security and justice are not
endangered
Every State shall settle its international disputes with
other States by peaceful means in such a manner that
international peace and security and justice are not
endangered.
States shall accordingly seek early and just settlement of
their international disputes by negotiation, inquiry,
mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement,
resort to regional agencies or arrangements or other
peaceful means of their choice. In seeking such a settlement
the parties shall agree upon such peaceful means as may be
appropriate to the circumstances and nature of the dispute.
The parties to a dispute have the duty, in the event of
failure to reach a solution by any one of the above peaceful
means, to continue to seek a settlement of the dispute by
other peaceful means agreed upon by them. 
States parties to an international dispute, as well as other
States shall refrain from any action which may aggravate the
Situation so as to endanger the maintenance of international
peace and security, and shall act in accordance with the
purposes and principles of the United Nations.
International disputes shall be settled on the basis of the
Sovereign equality of States and in accordance with the
Principle of free choice of means. Recourse to, or
acceptance of, a settlement procedure freely agreed to by
States with regard to existing or future disputes to which
they are parties shall not be regarded as incompatible with
sovereign equality.
Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs prejudices or derogates
from the applicable provisions of the Charter, in particular
those relating to the pacific settlement of international
disputes.
The principle concerning the duty not to intervene in
matters within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, in
accordance with the Charter
No State or group of States has the right to intervene,
directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the
internal or external affairs of any other State.
Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of
interference or attempted threats against the personality of
the State or against its political, economic and cultural
elements, are in violation of international law.
No State may use or encourage the use of economic political
or any other type of measures to coerce another State in
order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of
its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any
kind. Also, no State shall organize, assist, foment, finance,
incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or armed activities
directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of
another State, or interfere in civil strife in another State.
The use of force to deprive peoples of their national
identity constitutes a violation of their inalienable rights
and of the principle of non-intervention.
Every State has an inalienable right to choose its political,
economic, social and cultural systems, without interference
in any form by another State.
Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall be construed as
reflecting the relevant provisions of the Charter relating
to the maintenance of international peace and security. 
The duty of States to co-operate with one another in
accordance with the Charter
States have the duty to co-operate with one another,
irrespective of the differences in their political, economic
and social systems, in the various spheres of international
relations, in order to maintain international peace and
security and to promote international economic stability and
progress, the general welfare of nations and international
co-operation free from discrimination based on such
differences.
To this end:
(a) States shall co-operate with other States in the
maintenance of international peace and security;
(b) States shall co-operate in the promotion of universal
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all, and in the elimination of all forms of
racial discrimination and all forms of religious intolerance;
(c) States shall conduct their international relations in
the economic, social, cultural, technical and trade fields
in accordance with the principles of sovereign equality and
non-intervention;
(d) States Members of the United Nations have the duty to
take joint and separate action in co-operation with the
United Nations in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Charter.
States should co-operate in the economic, social and
cultural fields as well as in the field of science and
technology and for the promotion of international cultural
and educational progress. States should co-operate in the
promotion of economic growth throughout the world,
especially that of the developing countries.
The principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples
By virtue of the principle of equal rights and selfdetermination of peoples enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations, all peoples have the right freely to
determine, without external interference, their political
status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural
development, and every State has the duty to respect this
right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.
Every State has the duty to promote, through joint and
separate action, realization of the principle of equal 
rights and self-determination of peoples, in accordance with
the provisions of the Charter, and to render assistance to
the United Nations in carrying out the responsibilities
entrusted to it by the Charter regarding the implementation
of the principle, in order:
(a) To promote friendly relations and co-operation among
States; and
(b) To bring a speedy end to colonialism, having due regard
to the freely expressed will of the peoples concerned;
and bearing in mind that subjection of peoples to alien
subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a
violation of the principle, as well as a denial of
fundamental human rights, and is contrary to the Charter.
Every State has the duty to promote through joint and
separate action universal respect for and observance of
human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the
Charter.
The establishment of a sovereign and independent State, the
free association or integration with an independent State or
the emergence into any other political status freely
determined by a people constitute modes of implementing the
right of self-determination by that people.
Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action
which deprives peoples referred to above in the elaboration
of the present principle of their right to selfdetermination and freedom and independence. In their actions
against, and resistance to, such forcible action in pursuit
of the exercise of their right to self-determination, such
peoples are entitled to seek and to receive support in
accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter.
The territory of a colony or other Non-Self-Governing
Territory has, under the Charter, a status separate and
distinct from the territory of the State administering it;
and such separate and distinct status under the Charter
shall exist until the people of the colony or Non-SelfGoverning Territory have exercised their right of selfdetermination in accordance with the Charter, and
particularly its purposes and principles.
Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall be construed as
authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember
or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or
political unity of sovereign and independent States
conducting themselves in compliance with the principle of
equal rights and self-determination of peoples as described 
above and thus possessed of a government representing the
whole people belonging to the territory without distinction
as to race, creed or colour.
Every State shall refrain from any action aimed at the
partial or total disruption of the national unity and
territorial integrity of any other State or country.
The principle of sovereign equality of States
All States enjoy sovereign equality. They have equal rights
and duties and are equal members of the international
community, notwithstanding differences of an economic,
social, political or other nature.
In particular, sovereign equality includes the following
elements:
(a) States are judicially equal;
(b) Each State enjoys the rights inherent in full
sovereignty;
(c) Each State has the duty to respect the personality of
other States;
(d) The territorial integrity and political independence of
the State are inviolable;
(e) Each State has the right freely to choose and develop
its political, social, economic and cultural systems;
(f) Each State has the duty to comply fully and in good
faith with its international obligations and to live in
peace with other States.
The principle that States shall fulfil in good faith the
obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter-:
Every State has the duty to fulfil in good faith the
obligations assumed by it in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations.
Every State has the duty to fulfil in good faith its
obligations under the generally recognized principles and
rules of international law.
Every State has the duty to fulfil in good faith its
obligations under international agreements valid under the
generally recognized principles and rules of international
law. 
Where obligations arising under international agreements are
in conflict with the obligations of Members of the United
Nations under the Charter of the United Nations, the
obligations under the Charter shall prevail.
